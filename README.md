The boss requires a GUI tool that uses the GPT Da Vinci model. The main functions of the tool include: uploading .py files, downloading .apkg files, and displaying two windows. The first window is for code analysis and organization, breaking down the code into multiple small steps. This includes comments for each line or block of code, descriptions of functions, loops, or conditional statements, and segments of code divided by function or module with their descriptions. The second window is for listing and learning Python knowledge points for beginners, core knowledge points, and advanced knowledge points. For each concept, a set of memory cards is created, with a unified design for the content and style of the memory cards. The front of the card includes the English name of the knowledge point, the Chinese name, and a brief description. The back of the card uses the Feynman technique based on GPT's return to interpret the content on the front for beginners.
